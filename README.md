# EDA on Tornadoes in the USA (1950-2021)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset of tornadoes in the USA from 1950 to 2021. The notebook utilizes the dataset available on Kaggle, which includes information about various attributes of tornadoes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be accessed on Kaggle using the following link: [US Tornado Dataset (1950-2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/us-tornado-dataset-1950-2021). The dataset provides details about tornadoes, including their location, intensity, path, duration, and other related information.

## Notebook

The notebook file in this repository, named `EDA_on_Tornadoes_in_the_USA.ipynb`, contains the code and documentation for performing EDA on the tornado dataset. The notebook covers data loading, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

## Contents

The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section focuses on loading the tornado dataset, examining its structure, handling missing values, and performing any necessary data preprocessing steps to clean the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, the dataset is explored through visualizations and statistical analysis to gain insights into various aspects of tornadoes in the USA. Patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables are examined.

3. Data Visualization: This section presents visual representations of the tornado data, including maps, charts, and graphs, to enhance the understanding of tornado patterns and characteristics across different regions and time periods.

4. Conclusion: The concluding remarks summarize the key findings and insights derived from the EDA process, highlighting the significant features and trends observed in the tornado dataset.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Clone this repository and open the `EDA_on_Tornadoes_in_the_USA.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to execute the code cells and interact with the analysis.

Ensure that the required dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` before executing the notebook.
